1. **Homepage (Feed):**
   - Upon landing on the homepage, you see a clean and organized feed of posts or updates.
   - Each post includes an avatar (user profile picture), post content, and buttons for actions like "Like" and "Comment."
   - Hovering over a post reveals interactive effects (e.g., color changes) for the action buttons.

2. **Profile Page:**
   - Navigating to the profile page, you encounter a user profile section.
   - The profile picture (avatar) is prominently displayed, along with the user's name.
   - A brief bio provides context about the user (e.g., "Web developer | Coffee lover").
   - Recent activity (such as recent posts or interactions) may also be visible.

3. **Messages Page (Chat Interface):**
   - Clicking on the chat tab takes you to the messages page.
   - Here, you find a chat interface with message bubbles.
   - Each message includes the sender's avatar, the message content, and a timestamp.
   - You can type and send replies in the input field below each message.

4. **Notifications Page:**
   - Finally, you explore the notifications section.
   - Recent notifications are listed, each with an icon (e.g., a bell) and a brief description.
   - Notifications could include new followers, likes, comments, or other relevant updates.

**Styling and Layout:**
- The entire dashboard is visually cohesive, with a light blue background.
- Each section (feed, profile, chat, notifications) has its own  background, creating clear visual separation.
- Rounded corners and subtle shadows add a modern touch.
- The responsive design ensures the dashboard adapts well to different screen sizes.
